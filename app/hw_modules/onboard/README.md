## Brief
Onboard hardware: A some kind of hardware (HW) that is on the printed circuit board (PCB). Distinction from pluggable HW is made because onboard HW is generally intended to be permanent residing on the board.

## Portability of Code
Code is portable since drivers for the HW are same. The interface between communicating HW may change depending on the application but this is not in this file's scope.

## Parent Folder Name
onboard

## Properties Of The Parent Folder 
The parent folder should contain this README file, some software (SW) files related with onboard hardware (such as driver software), and any other necessary and related files. Files should be appropriately categorized and foldered as required.

## Note
If the application will not be associated with any kind of onboard HW module, then this README file and the parent folder that contains it can be deleted since they won't be necessary.
