## Brief
Detachable hardware: A some kind of hardware (HW) that is detachable and pluggable to the board. Distinction from onboard HW is made because detachable HW might vary throughout the life-cycle of the product and constant change and development might be necessary.

## Portability of Code
Code is portable since drivers for the HW are same. The interface between communicating HW may change depending on the application but this is not in this file's scope.

## Parent Folder Name
detachable

## Properties Of The Parent Folder 
The parent folder should contain this README file, some software (SW) files related with detachable hardware (such as driver software), and any other necessary and related files. Files should be appropriately categorized and foldered as required. 


## Note
If the application will not be associated with any kind of detachable HW module, then this README file and the parent folder that contains it can be deleted since they won't be necessary.
